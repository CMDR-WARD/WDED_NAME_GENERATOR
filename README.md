After much grinding, many commanders discovered that a custom station name costs 5000 arx.
But you can get unlimited dice rolls and five chances for free. There are really cool names among these random names, I wrote this script to help cmdrs to get the random name they want faster. You can also refresh manually until you get a satisfactory name.

**How to use:**

1. Enter the application, the interface is as shown:

4. Click the preview button:

    If the text is not clear, try to pick the color again.


6. Press the Start button:

   The script will keep refreshing the name until it contains your keyword.

* You can stop the script by pressing TAB in any case.

**Tips:**

* Not all words can be found. If you can't find them for a long time, I suggest trying another word.
* Try searching for the words you want on galaxy map. If there are sites with that name, they will most likely be refreshed and appear.
* This script is not as good as a custom name costing 5000 arx. If you can afford 5000 arx, it is recommended to use the normal in-game method.
